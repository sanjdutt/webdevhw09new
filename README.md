# HW09: Event App SPA

## Code Attribution

This homework includes code from and based on Prof Tuck's in-class PhotoBlog-Spa example.

Thank you to Prof Tuck for providing example code to illustrate communicating with the Phoenix server (CORS, api GET/POST), using React router, and handling file uploads.
